# crowd-analytics

Crowd Analytics is an area where getting data in real time is a gift. No wonder nowadays, it is the most active-oriented research and trendy topic in computer vision. Traditionally, three processing steps involve in crowd analysis, and these include pre-processing, object detection and event/behaviour recognition. However many existing applications do not process in real time. Our objective was to create a unique image processing application which is completely automated, needs no human intervention, is cost effective and at times better than human performance if not as good as it, which the present applications fail to do.
